    <h1>VaultDemoCli: Complete Technical Turnover &amp; Architecture</h1>
    <hr>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This document provides a comprehensive, single-page technical turnover for the VaultDemoCli system. It covers the
        full architecture, design patterns, validation logic, integration flows, error handling, extensibility, and
        testing strategy. Each architectural and flow diagram is embedded and extensively described, providing a
        complete reference for maintainers and future developers.</p>
    <hr>

    <h2>1. Unified System Architecture Overview</h2>
    <img src="unified-architecture-docs.png" alt="Unified System Architecture">
    <p class="caption">Unified System Architecture: High-level separation of CLI, service, and integration layers.</p>
    <p>This diagram presents the high-level architecture of the VaultDemoCli system. It illustrates the separation of
        concerns between the CLI layer (responsible for argument parsing and user interaction), the service layer (which
        orchestrates business logic, validation, and flow control), and the integration layer (handling external systems
        such as Vault, YAML configuration, and LDAP/JDBC string generation). The diagram emphasizes explicit boundaries
        between layers, ensuring maintainability, testability, and security. All data flows are unidirectional, and each
        layer exposes only minimal, well-defined interfaces to the next.</p>
    <hr>

    <h2>2. CLI and Service Layer Responsibilities</h2>
    <img src="unified-architecture-docs-1.png" alt="CLI and Service Layer Responsibilities">
    <p class="caption">CLI and Service Layer Responsibilities: Input validation, output routing, and orchestration.</p>
    <p>This diagram zooms in on the CLI and service layers, detailing their respective responsibilities. The CLI layer
        is shown handling all user input, validation, and output routing, while the service layer manages orchestration,
        error handling, and delegation to integration components. The explicit handoff between CLI and service is
        highlighted, ensuring that all parameter validation and error reporting are performed before any integration
        logic is invoked. This pattern enforces robust input validation and clear error boundaries.</p>
    <hr>

    <h2>3. Service and Integration Layer Breakdown</h2>
    <img src="unified-architecture-docs-2.png" alt="Service and Integration Layer Breakdown">
    <p class="caption">Service and Integration Layer Breakdown: Orchestration and modular integration.</p>
    <p>Here, the service layer is decomposed into its orchestration logic, with arrows indicating calls to integration
        components such as Vault HTTP clients, YAML configuration loaders, and LDAP/JDBC string builders. The diagram
        shows how the service layer acts as a coordinator, never directly exposing integration details to the CLI. Each
        integration component is depicted as a replaceable module, supporting future extensibility (e.g., adding new
        authentication backends or output formats).</p>
    <hr>

    <h2>4. Vault and LDAP Integration Details</h2>
    <img src="unified-architecture-docs-3.png" alt="Vault and LDAP Integration Details">
    <p class="caption">Vault and LDAP Integration: Secure credential retrieval and connection string generation.</p>
    <p>This diagram details the flow for Vault authentication and LDAP JDBC string generation. It shows the sequence of
        HTTP calls to Vault (POST for authentication, GET for secret retrieval), the extraction of credentials, and the
        construction of a multi-server LDAP JDBC string using configuration from YAML. Failover and multi-server support
        are visually represented, demonstrating how the system ensures high availability and robust connection handling.
    </p>
    <hr>

    <h2>5. Error Handling and Output Flow</h2>
    <img src="unified-architecture-docs-4.png" alt="Error Handling and Output Flow">
    <p class="caption">Error Handling and Output Flow: User-focused error reporting and technical logging.</p>
    <p>This diagram illustrates the error handling strategy across all layers. It shows how errors are caught at the
        boundaries (e.g., during file parsing, HTTP calls, or parameter validation), wrapped in application-specific
        exceptions, and routed to the appropriate output stream (<code>cmd.getErr()</code>). The diagram emphasizes
        minimal, user-focused error output on the console, with technical details logged for maintainers. The flow
        ensures that no stack traces or sensitive information are leaked to end users.</p>
    <hr>

    <h2>6. YAML Configuration and Validation</h2>
    <img src="unified-architecture-docs-5.png" alt="YAML Configuration and Validation">
    <p class="caption">YAML Configuration and Validation: Strict parsing and schema enforcement.</p>
    <p>This diagram visualizes the process of loading and validating YAML configuration files
        (<code>application.yaml</code>, <code>vaults.yaml</code>). It shows the strict parsing logic, schema validation,
        and the derivation of multi-server LDAP settings. The diagram highlights how missing or malformed entries result
        in immediate, user-visible errors, preventing misconfiguration and runtime surprises. The configuration layer is
        depicted as a foundation for all connection logic.</p>
    <hr>

    <h2>7. Testing and Automation Flows</h2>
    <img src="unified-architecture-docs-6.png" alt="Testing and Automation Flows">
    <p class="caption">Testing and Automation: Automated validation of all CLI flows and edge cases.</p>
    <p>This diagram documents the automated testing and validation flows. It shows how shell scripts (e.g.,
        <code>vault-demo.sh</code>) exercise both CLI modes, validate output, and cover all edge cases. The diagram
        includes regression and interactive testing paths, ensuring that all flows (including error cases) are
        continuously validated. This supports rapid iteration and safe refactoring.</p>
    <hr>

    <h2>8. Extensibility and Future Work</h2>
    <img src="unified-architecture-docs-7.png" alt="Extensibility and Future Work">
    <p class="caption">Extensibility and Future Work: Modular, configuration-driven evolution.</p>
    <p>This diagram outlines the system’s extensibility points. It shows how new authentication modes, output formats,
        or integration backends can be added by plugging into the integration layer, without modifying the CLI or
        service orchestration logic. Configuration-driven registration and modular design are emphasized, supporting
        forward-only evolution and maintainability.</p>
    <hr>

    <h2>9. Parameter Validation and Mode Selection</h2>
    <img src="diagrams34-1.png" alt="Parameter Validation and Mode Selection">
    <p class="caption">Parameter Validation and Mode Selection: Strict mode separation and error handling.</p>
    <p>This diagram details the CLI’s parameter validation logic. It visually distinguishes between “Simple Mode”
        (minimal parameters, YAML lookup) and “Full Parameter Mode” (all Vault parameters provided). The flowchart shows
        how any partial or mixed parameter set results in a hard error, enforcing strict mode separation and preventing
        ambiguous behavior.</p>
    <hr>

    <h2>10. Call Stack Overview</h2>
    <img src="diagrams34-2.png" alt="Call Stack Overview">
    <p class="caption">Call Stack Overview: End-to-end execution path from CLI to integration.</p>
    <p>This diagram presents the call stack from CLI entrypoint through argument parsing, validation, service
        orchestration, and integration calls. It highlights the explicit boundaries and the single-responsibility
        principle at each stack frame. The diagram is useful for onboarding new maintainers, as it clarifies the
        end-to-end execution path for any CLI invocation.</p>
    <hr>

    <h2>11. Execution Flow for Simulate/Real Modes</h2>
    <img src="diagrams34-3.png" alt="Execution Flow for Simulate/Real Modes">
    <p class="caption">Execution Flow for Simulate/Real Modes: All branches, error handling, and output.</p>
    <p>This diagram shows the full execution flow for both <code>--simulate</code> and <code>--real</code> modes. It
        includes all branches: parameter validation, Vault authentication, secret retrieval, LDAP string generation, and
        output. Error handling paths are clearly marked, showing how failures at any stage are reported and do not
        cascade.</p>
    <hr>

    <h2>12. Composite/Summary Diagram</h2>
    <img src="diagrams34.png" alt="Composite or Summary Diagram">
    <p class="caption">Composite/Summary: Holistic view of the CLI lifecycle and decision points.</p>
    <p>This diagram provides a holistic view of the entire CLI lifecycle, from argument parsing through to output,
        including all major decision points and error handling branches. It is ideal for high-level presentations or as
        a reference for future architectural changes.</p>
    <hr>
