# Kotlin Migration Plan: Incremental Conversion for CLI/Data Processing App

## Overview
This document outlines a phased, incremental approach to migrate the existing Java CLI/data-processing application to Kotlin. The plan is designed to minimize risk, maintain delivery velocity, and ensure production stability throughout the transition.

---

## Rationale
- **Modernization:** Kotlin offers improved expressiveness, null safety, and conciseness over Java.
- **Interoperability:** Kotlin and Java can coexist in the same codebase, enabling gradual migration.
- **Maintainability:** Cleaner code, fewer bugs, and easier onboarding for new developers.
- **Ecosystem:** Kotlin is fully supported by Maven, JUnit, and major IDEs.

---

## Guiding Principles
- **Incremental migration:** No "big bang" rewrite; migrate one module/class at a time.
- **Production stability:** All changes must pass existing tests and CI/CD checks.
- **Mixed codebase:** Java and Kotlin will coexist until migration is complete.
- **Minimal disruption:** Avoid breaking public APIs or CLI contracts during migration.
- **Documentation:** Update docs and onboarding guides as migration progresses.

---

## Phase 1: Preparation
- [ ] Add Kotlin to the build system (Maven plugin, dependencies).
- [ ] Set up basic Kotlin code style and linter (ktlint/detekt).
- [ ] Add a single Kotlin source directory (e.g., `src/main/kotlin`).
- [ ] Update CI/CD to compile and test Kotlin code.
- [ ] Document the mixed Java/Kotlin build process in the README.

**Checkpoint:**
- Kotlin code compiles and runs alongside Java; CI/CD is green.

---

## Phase 2: Low-Risk Migration Targets
- [ ] Identify utility classes, data classes, and stateless helpers as first candidates.
- [ ] Convert selected classes to Kotlin, one at a time.
- [ ] Ensure all tests pass after each conversion.
- [ ] Leverage Kotlin features (data classes, null safety) where it improves clarity.
- [ ] Update documentation and code owners for migrated files.

**Checkpoint:**
- At least one utility/helper module is fully Kotlin, with no regressions.

---

## Phase 3: Core Logic and CLI Layer
- [ ] Gradually migrate core business logic and CLI entry points.
- [ ] Refactor for idiomatic Kotlin where safe (e.g., sealed classes, extension functions).
- [ ] Maintain Java interop for modules not yet migrated.
- [ ] Update integration and CLI tests to cover Kotlin entry points.

**Checkpoint:**
- CLI and main flows run with Kotlin code; Java code remains for legacy modules.

---

## Phase 4: Database/Service Layer Migration
- [ ] Migrate database access and service classes to Kotlin.
- [ ] Replace Java-specific patterns with idiomatic Kotlin (e.g., coroutines if async, null safety).
- [ ] Ensure all integration tests pass.
- [ ] Monitor for subtle interop issues (e.g., nullability, checked exceptions).

**Checkpoint:**
- All core services and DB logic are Kotlin; only edge modules remain in Java.

---

## Phase 5: Final Cleanup and Java Removal
- [ ] Migrate remaining Java code (models, config, legacy utilities).
- [ ] Remove Java-specific build config and dependencies.
- [ ] Enforce Kotlin-only code style and CI checks.
- [ ] Update all documentation to reference Kotlin.

**Checkpoint:**
- Codebase is 100% Kotlin; Java is removed from main and test sources.

---

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Build/Interop Issues:** Use CI/CD and incremental migration to catch problems early.
- **Team Ramp-Up:** Provide Kotlin training and code review guidelines.
- **Hidden Java Assumptions:** Watch for Java-specific patterns (e.g., nulls, exceptions) that may not translate directly.
- **Third-Party Libraries:** Ensure all dependencies are compatible with Kotlin.
